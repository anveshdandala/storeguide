And NestlÃ© accepted the challenge.Our coffee specialist, Max Morgenthaler, was on a mission to create a delicious cup of coffee simply by adding water. Max and his team worked hard to find a new way to make instant coffee that would retain the coffeeÂ’s natural flavour. In 1938, they found the answer, and NESCAFÃ‰ was born. Named by using the first three letters in NestlÃ© and suffixing it with Â‘cafÃ©Â’, NESCAFÃ‰ became the new name in coffee. Up until the 1960s NESCAFÃ‰ was only available in tins. Then in 1961, they launched our very first glass jar, in Japan. It was a huge success and helped position NESCAFÃ‰ as a premium product. So in 1962, we decided to launch the glass jar in Europe too. This 1930s Swiss newspaper advert played on the speed and ease of making a NESCAFÃ‰. And it worked. NESCAFÃ‰ was an instant success. Never before had making coffee been so convenient, fast and easy.

During summer, there is barely a home in western India, be it Gujarat or Rajasthan, that doesnÂ’t partake in the festivity that is Aamras. Sometimes, they have it with milk, sometimes rotis and if time and patience allow, they even make sweets out of it. But the best way to go about Aamras is to have it directly as is. The way the ancients intended. Without preservatives or artificial flavour. Without frills or hassles. An honest treat for an honest dayÂ’s work.
A silkesque ale cascading down your throat - Soothing, serenading and more importantly, lingering. To remind you that the mango is indeed the true king of the fruit realm. And that we cannot help but submit to its tasty tyranny.

Functional Benefits
Believe or not, Aamras does have other functional benefits other than tasting like mythical, golden nectar from the heavens. For one thing, it helps prevent heart disease - The Beta-Carotene, Selenium, Potassium and Vitamin-E in the mangoes pretty much ensure that. Being rich in iron and copper, it also helps produce blood corpuscles. In addition to all this, it builds your immune system, aids in digestion, controls blood pressure, prevents anemia, relaxes muscle tissues and occasionally, reminds you of summer vacations.
